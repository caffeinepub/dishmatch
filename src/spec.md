# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Populate DishMatch with 50 mock Tokyo restaurants, integrate Unsplash carousel images, and display the gold logo in the app header.

**Planned changes:**
- Create mock dataset of 50 Tokyo restaurants with diverse genres (Italian, Kaiseki, Sushi, Yakiniku, Steakhouse, French, Bars, Vegan/Casual), balanced Date/Business modes, and Tokyo neighborhoods
- Include the 5 provided examples (TRATTORIA CREATTA, Mortons The Steakhouse Tokyo, Daigo, Piacere, T's TanTan) plus 45 additional restaurants
- Integrate Unsplash Source API for 5-photo carousels per restaurant using food/interior photography queries
- Display the uploaded gold plate/spoon logo as a circular icon in the app header

**User-visible outcome:** Users can swipe through 50 Tokyo restaurants with high-quality Unsplash food/interior photos in 5-photo carousels, see the DishMatch logo in the header, and filter between Date and Business dining modes.
