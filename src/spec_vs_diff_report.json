  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements: 50 Tokyo restaurant mock dataset (REQ-11), Unsplash placeholder image integration for carousels (REQ-12), and logo asset rendering (REQ-13). The backend contains a comprehensive restaurant dataset with the required structure, the frontend implements a 5-photo Unsplash carousel with tap navigation, and the logo is referenced in the Header component. However, the logo file itself is not present in the diff, and the restaurant count verification is limited by truncation.",
